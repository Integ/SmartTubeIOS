# BotGuard / PoToken — State and Migration Plan

> **What it unlocks:** native adaptive streaming at any quality without the WKWebView extraction layer — the same CDN access Android has.

> **Baseline commit (SmartTube):** `bce51e1b3cc1c9483fdbc4a2c40f4c9ccd13b173` — "Enhance audio track handling for YouTube HLS manifests"

---

## 1. What BotGuard Is

YouTube's CDN uses a challenge-response system called **BotGuard** to gate adaptive stream access. Any URL that contains `rqh=1` in its path will return HTTP 403 on media segments unless the `/player` request body and every stream URL carry a **Proof-of-Origin (PO) token** (`&pot=<base64>`).

The token proves that a real browser (or an authorised client) produced the request. Without it:
- All `c=IOS` adaptive URLs are `rqh=1` → unusable
- All `c=ANDROID_VR` adaptive URLs are `rqh=1` → 8s `loadTracks` stall (#208)
- Only the WKWebView spc= HLS path bypasses enforcement (uses the browser's own session cookie)

Android solves this via `PoTokenGate.getPoToken(client, videoId)` — a full BotGuard attestation pipeline that appends `&pot=...` to every adaptive URL before ExoPlayer touches them.

## 2. What Is Already Built

### Protocol and injection plumbing (complete, wired up)

```
InnerTubeModels.swift
  ╠═ public protocol PoTokenProvider: Sendable
  ║      func token(for videoId: String) async throws -> String
  ╠═ PlayerInfo.applyingPoToken(_ token: String) -> PlayerInfo
  ║      appends &pot=<token> to every adaptiveFormats URL
  ╚═ (called in InnerTubeAPI+Player.swift when poToken != nil)

InnerTubeAPI.swift
  ╠═ var poToken: String?           // cached token
  ╠═ var poTokenVideoId: String?    // videoId the token was minted for
  ╠═ var poTokenExpiry: Date?       // (reserved, not yet used)
  ╚═ let poTokenProvider: (any PoTokenProvider)?   // injected at init
```

**Zero-behaviour-change gate:** every injection site is guarded by `if let pot = poToken`. If `poTokenProvider` is nil (the current production default), the pipeline is identical to before. Enabling BotGuard requires only passing a `BotGuardClient()` at `InnerTubeAPI` construction.

### BotGuardClient.swift — full 5-phase pipeline (exists, blocked on input)

| Phase | What it does | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `WAA/Create` → interpreter JS URL + program + globalName | **Blocked** (see §3) |
| 2 | Load interpreter JS into `JSContext`, call `vm.a(program, …)` | ✅ implemented |
| 3 | `asyncSnapshotFn(callback, params)` → `botguardResponse` string | ✅ implemented |
| 4 | `WAA/GenerateIT` (botguardResponse) → `integrityTokenB64` | ✅ implemented |
| 5 | `webPoSignalOutput[0](integrityBytes)` → minter → mint(videoId) → base64 | ✅ implemented |

Key implementation details already handled:
- All JSContext work runs on a dedicated `jsQueue` (real OS thread, not Swift cooperative pool) — `DispatchSemaphore.wait()` inside is safe
- `Promise` resolution via pure-JS `then` handler + microtask pumping (avoids unreliable Swift block callbacks during JSC microtask drain)
- Multiple WAA Create response format strategies (JSON-array layouts, JSPB binary proto, nested/flat fields, URL-scan fallback)
- Dynamic VM discovery when `globalName` is empty (scans `globalThis` for an object with `.a` method)
- Full BotGuardClientTests.swift with fake interpreter JS (synchronous minter, Promise minter, Promise init variants)
- Reference: https://github.com/LuanRT/BgUtils (MIT)

## 3. The Blocker: WAA Create API Response Format

The WAA Create endpoint (`jnn-pa.googleapis.com/$rpc/google.internal.waa.v1.Waa/Create`) has changed its response format. The current `BotGuardClient.fetchChallenge()` tries five parse strategies in sequence:

1. `outer[1]` is an inner JSON array with 5 elements → `[msgId, hash, url, program, globalName]`
2. `outer[1]` is an inner JSON array with 4 elements → `[hash, url, program, globalName]`
3. `outer[1]` is a JSPB binary proto blob → flat fields at proto field numbers 2, 5, 6
4. `outer[1]` is a JSPB binary proto blob → nested message in field 1
5. **Fallback:** treat `outer[1]` as raw program; fetch the current interpreter JS from the YouTube homepage `/s/player/.../base.js`

None of these strategies currently produces a working interpreter JS + program pair. The BgUtils project (the canonical reference for this protocol) tracks these format changes — the last confirmed-working response format in the code dates from when BotGuardClient was first written.

**Exact failure mode:** Phase 1 completes without throwing (falls through to fallback), but the fetched YouTube player JS is not the BotGuard interpreter VM — it is the full YouTube player — and `vm.a()` in Phase 2 fails to find a callable VM object.

---

## 4. Approaches to Fix It

### Option A — Fix WAA Create parsing ✅ IMPLEMENTED — commit `7404f0b`

**What changed:** The WAA Create endpoint now returns a **scrambled** `outer[1]` string (BgUtils v3.2+ format). The old implementation treated it as a binary protobuf blob and failed all 5 parse strategies. The new implementation:
1. Base64-decodes `outer[1]`
2. Adds 97 to each byte (mod 256) — the inverse of YouTube's subtraction scramble
3. UTF-8-decodes → JSON-parses the inner challenge array
4. Reads `wrappedScript` (inline VM JS) or `wrappedUrl` (URL to fetch VM JS from) from the new 6-element inner layout

All 17 `BotGuardClient` unit tests updated to mock the new scrambled format. 17/17 pass.

**What to do:**
1. Make a raw `WAA/Create` request with the existing key and requestKey and log the full binary response
2. Compare against the current BgUtils `parseChallengeData` implementation
3. Update the parse strategy in `fetchChallenge()` to match the current field layout

**How to test without running the full pipeline:**
```swift
// In BotGuardClientTests.swift — add a live network test (disabled by default):
// let client = BotGuardClient()
// let challenge = try await client.fetchChallenge()   // make fetchChallenge() internal
// XCTAssertFalse(challenge.interpreterJS.isEmpty)
// XCTAssertFalse(challenge.program.isEmpty)
```

**Reference:** https://github.com/LuanRT/BgUtils/blob/main/lib/utils/Challenge.ts — `parseChallengeData()` is updated whenever YouTube changes the WAA format.

**Risk:** YouTube changes the format periodically. This requires ongoing maintenance.

---

### Option B — WKWebView pot= extraction (no format chasing) ✅ IMPLEMENTED — commit `4a044ea`

Instead of running the BotGuard pipeline natively, extract the `pot=` token that the YouTube JS player has already computed inside the hidden WKWebView that we already load for HLS extraction.

**How it works:**
- The WKWebView already loads the YouTube watch page and executes the real YouTube JS player
- The player calls `yt.config_.WEB_PLAYER_CONTEXT_CONFIGS` which contains a signed `po_token` after BotGuard passes in the browser context
- Extract this value via `WKWebView.evaluateJavaScript("yt.config_.WEB_PLAYER_CONTEXT_CONFIGS[...].poToken")` after `hlsManifestUrl` is available

**What needs to change:**
1. In `tryWebViewHLS` (after WKWebView extracts `hlsManifestUrl`), also extract `poToken` from the page JS context
2. Pass the token to `InnerTubeAPI` via `applyPoToken(_:forVideoId:)` (add this method)
3. In the iOS client fetch path, call `applyingPoToken` before returning `PlayerInfo`

**Advantage:** No WAA API format maintenance. The browser computes the token correctly by definition; we just read it.

**Limitation:** pot= token is tied to the WKWebView session. If adaptive streams from the iOS client (`c=IOS`) are also rqh=1, they may need the token to be re-minted per-session using the same credentials. Works well for the same video the WKWebView loaded; cross-video reuse needs investigation.

**Implementation effort:** ~50 lines in `PlaybackViewModel+Fallback.swift` + `InnerTubeAPI.swift`

---

### Option C — Server-side attestation proxy

Run BotGuardClient on a server; the app fetches a short-lived token per videoId via a private HTTPS endpoint.

**Concern:** Creates a centralised infrastructure dependency and a privacy risk (server sees every videoId lookup). Not recommended.

---

### Option D — Embed bundled interpreter JS

Bundle a pinned copy of the BotGuard interpreter JS with the app (updating it periodically via app releases or a CDN fetch at launch).

**Concern:** The interpreter hash rotates frequently (observed every few days in BgUtils). An out-of-date bundled JS causes silent token generation failure. Higher maintenance burden than Option A.

---

## 5. What Changes in the Playback Pipeline Once It Works

With a valid `pot=` token, the WKWebView extraction layer becomes optional:

| Scenario | Today | With BotGuard |
|---|---|---|
| iOS adaptive (`c=IOS`, rqh=1) | Skip → WKWebView HLS | Direct DASH adaptive via `AVURLAsset` composition |
| Quality picker | Rebuild AVPlayerItem + new proxy | In-situ `preferredMaximumResolution` hint on existing item |
| Audio tracks (dubbed) | HLS `YT-EXT-AUDIO-CONTENT-ID` variant filter | Standard `AVMediaSelectionGroup` (if DASH MPD includes them) or same HLS path |
| 4K on tvOS | Capped at 1080p (HLS manifest limit) | 1440p / 2160p adaptive formats available |
| Cold start latency | ~6–14s (WKWebView JS eval + manifest fetch) | ~1–2s (iOS client player API response) |
| WKWebView dependency | Required for all rqh=1 videos | Optional fallback only |

**Fallback chain with BotGuard:**
```
fetchPlayerInfo(c=IOS) → applyingPoToken(pot) → attemptComposition(adaptive)
  → success (direct DASH)
  → failure → tryWebViewHLS (WKWebView spc= HLS, as today)
  → failure → muxed 360p
```

**DASH composition path** (currently bypassed for rqh=1 — see `#208` guard): `qualityCapVideoURL + bestAdaptiveAudioURL` are passed to `AVMutableComposition`. With valid `pot=`, the `rqh=1` CDN gate is satisfied and segments are served normally.

---

## 6. Wiring BotGuardClient Into Production

Once Phase 1 is unblocked (either by fixing WAA parsing or by Option B WKWebView extraction):

```swift
// In PlaybackViewModel (or wherever InnerTubeAPI is initialised):
let api = InnerTubeAPI(
    authToken: authToken,
    poTokenProvider: BotGuardClient()   // add this
)
```

That single change enables the entire pipeline — all injection points are already gated on `poToken != nil` with zero-behaviour fallback.

**Token refresh strategy (to add):**
- Cache the minted token in `InnerTubeAPI.poToken` (already stored)
- Invalidate when `poTokenVideoId != currentVideoId` (already checked at call site)
- YouTube pot= tokens are tied to (videoId, session); safe to reuse for the same video across seeks/quality switches

---

## 7. Open Questions

1. **Does the pot= token from WKWebView (Option B) actually get produced?** First empirical test run (2026-05-26, video `LSMQ3U1Thzw`, iOS Simulator): YouTube player in WKWebView did NOT include `serviceIntegrityDimensions.poToken` in its `/player` request body. The JS interceptor confirmed: `URL captured source=apiResponse` with no pot field. This means BotGuard challenges are not always issued by YouTube's server — the challenge appears conditionally based on session fingerprint risk score. To observe a pot token, try: authenticated session, fresh simulator, or a video that YouTube's anti-bot heuristics flag more aggressively.

2. **Does the pot= token from WKWebView (Option B) satisfy the CDN for `c=IOS` adaptive URLs?** The WKWebView runs as `c=WEB_REMIX`; pot= tokens may be client-scoped. Needs a live test: extract the WKWebView pot=, append to an `rqh=1` adaptive URL, make a range request, check HTTP status code.

3. **Does DASH adaptive from iOS client include dubbed audio tracks?** Android's in-memory MPD construction merges separate video + audio `adaptiveFormats` entries. If dubbed audio is only in HLS manifests (as separate language stream variants), the HLS proxy path remains necessary even with BotGuard.

4. **How often does the WAA Create response format change?** If we go with Option A, we need a monitoring strategy (e.g. a nightly CI job that hits the endpoint and validates the challenge parse succeeds).
